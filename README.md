## Description

I will have a slot machine game. On click, a lever will be pulled and the images in three columns will appear to scroll. The lever will release and the images will slowly cease scrolling. The user wins if three like images appear in a row. Depending on the value of each image, a number is added to the user's bank which will appear in the upper righthand corner of the screen


### Landing Page

When a player begins the game, they will see an imput field which allows them to add their name. They will also be given the option to 'insert' one of three dollar amounts ($1, $5, and $10). Depending on how much they select, they will begin with the corresponding amount of $ in their bank.

### Game Initialization
When the game is initialized, the player will be taken to a screen containing the image of the slot machine and the lever. His/her name will appear in the upper righthand corner along with their bank balance.

### Playing The Game

The user will be expected to pull the lever(click), and the images will scroll. After a certain time of scrolling, each column will stop scrolling and land on a single image along the center. Each column will stop scrolling a different time. 

### Winning The Game

Each round (spin) is one play. The play is over when the scrolling stops. If there are three images in a row, the user wins. If the three images are not alike, the user loses. 

The entire game ends when the user has exhausted his/her bank balance.

### Game Reset

A play again button will appear upon the game finishing.
